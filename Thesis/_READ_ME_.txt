This is the master file for your thesis Tex project. It is the script that will combine all the files together to create your Thesis.pdf. 

NOTE!
When you 'build' your thesis for the first time a plathora of auto-generated files will fill up this folder. These files are of little consequence and can be ignored. The only two files of interest are Thesis.tex and Thesis.pdf. They should still exist in this folder.
